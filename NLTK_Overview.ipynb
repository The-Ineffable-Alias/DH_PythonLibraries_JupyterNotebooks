    "## Stop Words\n",
    "Stop words are words that do not add any meaning to the text. And we will see later that they can often introduce \"noise\" into the analysis of a text or corpus. A common practice in Natural Language Processing is to remove stop words from a text. The purpose of removing stopwords is that only words that can provide useful insight into the text will remain. Stop words are words like \"the\", \"a\", \"it\". NLTK gives us an easy way to remove stop words form a text by using a corpus called `stopwords`. NLTK also provides stopwords in many languages. "

      "little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\n",

      "hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\n",

      "'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes\n",

      "\n",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\n",

      "she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must\n",
      "be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure\n",
      "herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\n",
      "about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\n",
      "out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\n",
      "it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\n",
      "sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and\n",

      "but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\n",
      "lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'\n",
      "thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!\n",
      "And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\n",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\n",
      "had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\n",
      "made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\n",
      "was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",
      "being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\n",
      "However, everything is queer to-day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she\n",
      "began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of\n",
      "a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n",
      "'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\n",
      "the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would\n",
      "YOU like cats if you were me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\n",
      "thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\n",
      "pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\n",
      "washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's\n",
      "such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried\n",
      "Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\n",
      "felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any\n",
      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\n",
      "cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\n",
      "you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He\n",
      "says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming\n",
      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n",
      "face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n",
      "a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n",
      "way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",

      "\n",

      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\n",
      "to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\n",
      "known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\n",
      "Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than\n",
      "you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without\n",
      "knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\n",
      "age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you\n",
      "dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\n",
      "in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\n",
      "sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did\n",
      "you speak?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\n",
      "the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what\n",
      "\"it\" means.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the\n",

      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '\"--found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\n",
      "crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\n",
      "Normans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning\n",
      "to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that\n",
      "the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\n",
      "but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\n",
      "and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as\n",
      "you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\n",
      "you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact\n",
      "shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\n",
      "the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded\n",
      "round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\n",
      "and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\n",
      "(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\n",
      "of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\n",
      "'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\n",
      "and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\n",
      "way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\n",
      "a-piece all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why\n",
      "it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at\n",
      "the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling\n",
      "about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\n",

      "\n",
      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\n",
      "the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\n",
      "had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\n",
      "out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\n",
      "Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\n",
      "in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\n",
      "had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How\n",
      "surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't\n",
      "think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it\n",
      "began ordering people about like that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\n",
      "of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\n",
      "and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\n",
      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\n",
      "with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\n",
      "to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what\n",
      "this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really\n",
      "I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't\n",
      "grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't\n",
      "drunk quite so much!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\n",
      "yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\n",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\n",
      "grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')\n",
      "\n",
      "'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do\n",
      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm\n",
      "sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em\n",
      "together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll\n",
      "do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming\n",
      "down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I\n",
      "won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\n",
      "go down the chimney!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to\n",
      "herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in\n",
      "Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",
      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'\n",
      "then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy\n",
      "now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought\n",
      "Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the\n",
      "roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",

      "at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\n",
      "her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\n",
      "who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain\n",
      "yourself!'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won't you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,\n",
      "you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important\n",
      "to say!'\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\n",
      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",
      "arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think\n",
      "you're changed, do you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I\n",
      "used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "'Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it all came\n",
      "different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,\n",
      "    'And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\n",
      "    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "    'I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "    Why, I do it again and again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,\n",
      "    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\n",
      "    Pray, what is the reason of that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "    'I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\n",
      "    Allow me to sell you a couple?'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "    For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\n",
      "    Pray how did you manage to do it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,\n",
      "    And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "    Has lasted the rest of my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose\n",
      "    That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\n",
      "    What made you so awfully clever?'\n",
      "\n",
      "   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\n",
      "    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!\n",

      "    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",

      "have got altered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\n",
      "there was silence for some minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What size do you want to be?' it asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one\n",
      "doesn't like changing so often, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\n",
      "before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'\n",
      "said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\n",
      "itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\n",
      "she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily\n",
      "offended!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",
      "hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In\n",
      "a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\n",
      "to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\n",
      "round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\n",
      "stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\n",
      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\n",
      "blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which\n",
      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my\n",
      "shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'\n",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\n",
      "tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\n",
      "neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",
      "was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\n",
      "and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems\n",
      "to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\n",
      "hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those\n",
      "serpents! There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;\n",
      "'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\n",
      "haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\n",
      "the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to\n",
      "invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\n",
      "with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use\n",
      "denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an\n",
      "egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're\n",
      "a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking\n",
      "for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't\n",
      "like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done\n",
      "now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\n",
      "to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives\n",
      "there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\n",
      "I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",
      "over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\n",
      "to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'\n",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\n",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she\n",
      "repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first\n",
      "question, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really\n",
      "dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It's enough to drive one crazy!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",

      "\n",
      "'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'\n",

      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know\n",

      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in\n",
      "an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get\n",
      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of\n",
      "what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\n",
      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'\n",
      "\n",

      "it twelve? I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'\n",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\n",

      "\n",

      "a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just\n",
      "like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting\n",
      "like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\n",
      "straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute\n",
      "or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\n",
      "it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'\n",
      "thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\n",
      "see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\n",
      "eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\n",
      "like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'\n",
      "she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with\n",
      "this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,\n",
      "that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\n",
      "be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\n",
      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\n",
      "it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\n",
      "tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n",
      "'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you\n",
      "tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't much care where--' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n",
      "'What sort of people live about here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March\n",
      "Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.\n",
      "You're mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how\n",
      "do you know that you're mad?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I suppose so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and\n",
      "wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?'\n",
      "\n",

      "yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as\n",
      "it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and\n",
      "vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin\n",
      "without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\n",
      "of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\n",
      "about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\n",
      "saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\n",

      "CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I\n",
      "suppose it doesn't mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice\n",
      "coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat\n",
      "down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\n",
      "for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; 'it's very rude.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\n",
      "was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've\n",
      "begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the\n",
      "March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I\n",
      "say--that's the same thing, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say\n",
      "that \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that \"I like what I\n",
      "get\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, 'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\n",
      "as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\n",
      "thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\n",
      "which wasn't much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month\n",
      "is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit\n",
      "the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,\n",
      "you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a\n",
      "funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\n",
      "tell what o'clock it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite\n",
      "understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk\n",
      "about wasting IT. It's HIM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\n",
      "'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time\n",
      "when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",
      "('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I\n",
      "shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We\n",
      "quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "     How I wonder what you're at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "         Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,\n",
      "twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch\n",
      "it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,\n",
      "and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again\n",
      "before it's done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in\n",
      "questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd\n",
      "have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't\n",
      "take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take\n",
      "MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, 'It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\n",
      "the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\n",
      "cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\n",
      "from?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should\n",
      "think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\n",
      "notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\n",
      "some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of\n",
      "things--everything that begins with an M--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why with an M?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why not?' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\n",
      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\n",
      "things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a\n",
      "drawing of a muchness?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't\n",
      "think--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\n",
      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",
      "the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\n",
      "the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her\n",
      "way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\n",
      "my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\n",
      "leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But\n",
      "everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in\n",
      "she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n",
      "glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,\n",
      "and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\n",
      "led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\n",
      "had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\n",
      "then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at\n",
      "last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\n",
      "fountains.\n",

      "\n",
      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\n",
      "growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\n",
      "painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went\n",
      "nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of\n",
      "them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like\n",
      "that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my\n",
      "elbow.'\n",
      "\n",
      "On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the\n",
      "blame on others!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only\n",
      "yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for\n",
      "bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\n",
      "them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\n",
      "all of them bowed low.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting\n",
      "those roses?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\n",
      "voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n",
      "RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\n",
      "So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this\n",
      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\n",
      "the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\n",
      "with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\n",
      "them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\n",
      "nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's\n",
      "crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\n",
      "procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of\n",
      "a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the\n",
      "Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",
      "Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all. I needn't be afraid of them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\n",
      "were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\n",
      "faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\n",
      "pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\n",
      "courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no\n",
      "business of MINE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them\n",
      "over!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\n",
      "gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\n",
      "the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,\n",
      "turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going\n",
      "down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n",
      "'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the\n",
      "soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\n",
      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted\n",
      "in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\n",
      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes!' shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under\n",
      "sentence of execution.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What for?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n",
      "\"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\n",
      "up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\n",
      "her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\n",
      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\n",
      "blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\n",
      "time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one\n",
      "left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\n",
      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n",
      "'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use\n",
      "speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\n",
      "enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\n",
      "oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;\n",
      "at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\n",
      "arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\n",
      "at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to\n",

      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\n",
      "the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\n",
      "the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\n",
      "after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",

      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\n",
      "fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",

      "history, she do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\n",
      "she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\n",
      "not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "angrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\n",
      "added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n",
      "Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\n",
      "to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\n",
      "and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",

      "\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n",
      "\n",

      "the sea.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I\n",

      "and sadly:--\n",
      "\n",
      " '\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n",

      " See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n",
      " They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\n",

      " \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",

      "about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters\n",
      "to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\n",
      "way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get\n",
      "them out again. That's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you\n",

      "\n",
      "'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "'any shrimp could have told you that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and\n",
      "told me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",

      "\n",
      "'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said\n",

      "\n",

      "'explanations take such a dreadful time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\n",
      "on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\n",
      "her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the\n",
      "words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\n",
      "and said 'That's very curious.'\n",

      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",

      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n",
      "and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n",
      "was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n",
      "that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\n",
      "trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\n",
      "seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n",
      "her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\n",
      "herself, 'because of his great wig.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n",
      "not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n",
      "(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\n",
      "this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n",
      "it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n",
      "age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\n",
      "just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\n",

      "\n",
      "'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\n",

      "\n",
      "'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n",
      "hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\n",
      "King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n",
      "'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n",
      "obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n",
      "of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\n",
      "hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\n",

      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",

      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n",
      "long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",

      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",

      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n",

      "Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",

    "## Parts of Speech Tagging (POS)\n",
    "Tagging is a way of identifying certain properties of words, or tokens, in NLTK. For example, we could identify verbs and nouns in a text by tagging them with a string that indicates this semantic meaning. Identifying the proper parts of speech is complicated in a text, particularly if there are many unknown, or new uses of words, or the text is highly idiosyncratic (like Twitter messages).
